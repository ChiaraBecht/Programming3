# Programming 3: Big Data Computing

This repository contains the weekly assignments and a final assignment practicing parallel and distributed computing for biological big data. 

- Assignment 1: parallel computing using pythons multiprocessing library to conduct the task downloading Pubmed Abstracts
- Assignment 2: distributed computing using pythons multiprocessing library with Manager objects to conduct the task downloading author lists and pubmed articles
- Assignment 3: distributed computing using SLURM scheduler to run BLASTP with increasing numbers of processes
- Assignment 4: distributed computing using SLURM scheduler and GNU parallel to optimize the assembly of a sequencing run with the velvet assembler
- Assignment 5: distributed computing using pyspark to process a Protein GO annotation dataframe that cannot be fitted into memory at once
- Assignment 6: final project for which i have chosen project 3: distributed computing using SLURM and python multiprocessing to map a metagenomics sample that got sequenced with the MinIon sequencer onto all known bacterial genomes. For these mappings extract functional annotations from genbank files for the genes that are spanned by the mapped reads. (More details can be found in the Assignment 6 readme)
